%% ------------ Abstract ------------
\begin{abstract}
Parking management is a daily challenge in urban and corporate spaces. Traditional methods, which rely on manual records, often result in errors, delays, and limited vehicle traceability. To address these challenges, we propose the development of a low-cost digital application that optimizes the vehicle entry and exit registration process. This solution improves internal organization, reduces human error, and facilitates vehicle flow monitoring, leading to more efficient management of available parking spaces. The system was implemented and tested, demonstrating its potential for enhancing parking lot management and reducing operational inefficiencies.
