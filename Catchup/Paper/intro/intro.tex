Parking management is a daily challenge in urban and corporate spaces. Traditional methods based on manual records often lead to errors, delays, and limited vehicle traceability. In response to this problem, we propose the development of a low-cost digital application that optimizes the entry and exit registration process, offering more efficient management of available space. This system helps improve internal organization, reduce human error, and facilitate the monitoring of vehicle flow.
